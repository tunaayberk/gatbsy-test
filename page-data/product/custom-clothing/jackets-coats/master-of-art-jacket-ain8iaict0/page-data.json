Wear it with the matching trousers or any skirt or pants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><br />Aiste says \"The wholesomeness of the landscape and the vast expanse of nature that surround me is my inspiration. The geometric patterns of the tree trunks in the forest, the rise and fall of the waves in the sea, the colors of the passing seasons: all these elements come together when I produce my hand-sewn fabrics. I begin with rolls of plain material and sew hundreds of small seams onto it, creating my own unique textured cloth.&nbsp; Apparel from this texturized material will not become wrinkly; wherever you may go, simply pack them to your travel bag.&nbsp; No additional ironing is needed before you wear this garment.\"</p>\r\n</div>","properties":[{"propname":"Garment_Care","propvalue":"Spot clean and hand wash cold, dry flat.
