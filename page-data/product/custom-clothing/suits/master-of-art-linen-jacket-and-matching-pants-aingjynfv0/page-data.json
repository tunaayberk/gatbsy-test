The geometric patterns of the tree trunks in the forest, the rise and fall of the waves in the sea, the colors of the passing seasons: all these elements come together when I produce my hand-sewn fabrics. I begin with rolls of plain material and sew hundreds of small seams onto it, creating my own unique textured cloth.&nbsp; Apparel from this texturized material will not become wrinkly; wherever you may go, simply pack them to your travel bag.&nbsp; No additional ironing is needed before you wear this garment.\"</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p></div>","properties":[{"propname":"Garment_Care","propvalue":"Spot clean and hand wash cold.
